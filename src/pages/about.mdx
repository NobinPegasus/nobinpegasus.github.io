I have recently graduated from **Shahjalal University of Science and Technology**, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Since my childhood, I have always been fascinated by this ***MAGIC BOX*** called computer. This magic box has always been a black box to me. I am still on a long journey to deciphering this black box.

#### Hobbies
Outside of electronics world I love playing football, exploring new places, cycling on long rides, practising Karate and other dopamine inducing tasks. And when it's neither computers nor thrill, I just love spending hours on end gossiping with my friends.
