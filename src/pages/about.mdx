I have graduated from **Shahjalal University of Science and Technology**, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Since my childhood, I have always been fascinated by this ***MAGIC BOX*** called computer. This magic box has always been a black box to me. I am still on a long journey to deciphering this black box.
I've also grown interest towards eBPF recently. You can check some of my eBPF works [here](https://github.com/NobinPegasus/xdp-tutorial/tree/nobin)

#### Interests
Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Systems Programming, Low Level Security, Psychology, eBPF

#### Hobbies
Outside of electronics world I love playing football, exploring new places, cycling on long rides, practising Karate and other dopamine inducing tasks. And when it's neither computers nor thrill, I just love spending hours on end gossiping with my friends.
