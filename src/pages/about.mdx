I am a world-class software developer living in Atlantic Canada. For [five years](/blog/5-years-of-ios/), I was focused on iOS development, but [my area of interest broadened](/blog/5-more-years-of-building-software/) and now I do many things. I'm keenly interested in [TypeScript](/blog/javascript-is-good-actually/), [ReactNative](/blog/the-case-for-react-native/), and [GraphQL](/blog/the-spirit-of-moya/). I'm married, with two cats. After [contributing to open source](https://github.com/ashfurrow) so much, [it brainwashed me](/blog/open-source-ideology/). I've [written books](/books) and I've [made photos](https://photos.ashfurrow.com) and now I'm [playing guitar](/blog/just-play/).

Community is incredibly important to me; I’ve only been able to accomplish what I have because of the kindness and generosity of others. I owe it to the people who helped me to help others now, which is why I volunteered with [Coalition for Queens](https://www.c4q.nyc) and ran a [Peer Lab](https://peerlab.community) every week in New York [for five years](/blog/5-years-of-peer-lab/).

If you want to get in touch, [Mastodon](https://masto.ashfurrow.com/@ashfurrow) is probably the best way to reach me. I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashfurrow). Only if you have to, you can email [ash@ashfurrow.com](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com).

Over my career, I’ve been fortunate to work at some amazing places.

### Shopify

I've only recently [joined Shopify](/blog/joining-shopify/) so I don't yet have much to say. Expect big things.

### Artsy

I joined [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net) in New York to help accomplish their ambitious goal: a future where art is as popular as music. That vision resonated with me, and for seven years I was proud to work towards it. After building Artsy software in TypeScript, Swift, Objective-C, Ruby, Scala – [whatever it took](/blog/perspective-of-the-polyglot/) – I moved to technical leadership. I am most proud of leading the migration to [Artsy's mobile-first product strategy](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/09/29/becoming-mobile-first-at-artsy/).

Most of the code I worked on [is open source](https://github.com/artsy) and I wrote a lot on [Artsy's Engineering Blog](http://artsy.github.io).

### Teehan+Lax

After learning the importance of design at 500px, I moved to Canada’s leading design agency, [Teehan+Lax](http://www.teehanlax.com), to learn more. I developed keen collaboration skills while working closely with designers and clients to realize outstanding products.

### 500px

[500px](https://500px.com/) was a site that aimed to host the world’s best photography. Like Flickr, but only for your _best_ shots. I developed their first iPad app, and later led the iOS team to ship the new universal app.
