              <p>
                I worked from the basement of Ashley's mother's house (there was
                no WiFi so I had to connect directly to their modem with
                ethernet). Armed with cs193p courses from Stanford (instructed
                that year by Evan Doll), I learnt the basics of iOS app
                structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also had a few reference books and some help from a friend.{' '}
                <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbrennan">Jason Brennan</a> and
                I talked a lot over Google Wave. He helped me with everything

            <Entry title="Coffee Timer" img={coffeetimer}>
              <p>
                This was to be my first app. I wanted to create something that I
                would want to use. I really liked using a coffee press but would
                often forget it was brewing and spoil the coffee. A timer to
                make coffee would be perfect: simple enough to execute but
                meaningful enough to motivate me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The app was pretty simple: some models were deserialized from
                NSUserDefaults, presented in a table view, blah blah blah. It
                wasn't much, but it was mine and I was proud of it. Seeing my
                software run on my iPod touch for the first time was as close to
                a religious experience as I've ever had.

            <Entry title="WWDC Scholarship">
              <p>
                Someone, I think on Twitter, recommended that students apply for
                a WWDC scholarship. I had no idea what it was, but I figured I'd
                throw my hat in. I wrote about CoffeeTimer and some background
                about me, and then I forgot about it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weeks or months later, I got an email from Apple saying that I
                had won. I Googled "WWDC", realized that this was kind of a big
                deal, and asked Ashley what I should do. She encouraged me to
                accept the offer and my parents helped me pay for my plane
                ticket to San Francisco. I quickly applied for a passport – this
                would be my first ever flight.

                WWDC was an amazing experience. From the city of San Francisco
                to the energy in the air – it was incredible. The trip really
                opened up my eyes to what else is out there in the world – it
                was the spark that drove me to keep travelling.

                iOS 4 and the iPhone 4 were announced. Xcode 4 was announced.
                GCD was ported to iOS (this was important to me, as I had
                recently learnt Haskell and used LINQ in .Net). I dove in.

                One presentation really stood out to me: Chris Parker giving his
                annual &quot;What's new in UIKit talk. I had never seen a
                professional developer care so much about design. In the labs, I
                was lucky enough to talk to him in-person.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later that week, I visited the Design lab and got feedback on
                CoffeeTimer. It was the first time I had met a designer.

              <p>
                While at WWDC, I had another idea for an app. It wasn't anything
                too special: just a metric/imperial unit calculator. But I made
                it so that it uses fractions instead of decimals, as well as
                colloquial terms like &quot;a pinch of salt&quot; or &quot;a
                stick of butter.&quot; I even had a section of things like
                converting rainbows to smiles. It was the first time that I made
                delightfulness a priority when making software.

                That Summer, I bought my first ever iPhone. It was a big deal
                since, as a student, my budget was tight. However, the iPhone
                4's retina display – a first of its kind – was compelling enough
                as a developer to justify it.

                Later, I redesigned CoffeeTimer with some basic Photoshop skills
                I had picked up from some online tutorials. In hindsight, it
                looks atrocious, but I was trying and learning.

            <Entry title="First Contract">
              <p>
                That Fall, in preparation for a provincial election, the youth
                organization of one of the parties hired me to make them an
                iPhone app. It was my biggest undertaking: postal code lookups,
                GPS, maps, pulling data from a JSON file I had on the Internet,
                localization, and more. I was given free reign over the branding
                and eventually charged my client for 100 hours of work.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was the first time that I had worked as a freelancer. The
                experience was mixed – there were communication problems with
                the client, and of course it was a hassle to get paid. But I had
                avoided the biggest mistake freelancers make: I had them sign a
                contract.

            <Entry title="Second Contract" img={unb}>
              <p>
                Emboldened by my success of my first contract, I looked around
                for more opportunities. My university was interested in using an
                iPad to collect information from potential students at
                recruitment fairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The technical aspects of the job were not difficult – the
                information would be transferred off of the devices via email.
                But the design of the product was problematic. While the
                recruitment office wanted as much information as possible, the
                recruiters knew that more fields for recruits to fill out would
                mean fewer people filled them out at all. It was my first
                experience balancing priorities between two stakeholders.

            <Entry title="Solar System Simulator" img={simulator}>
              <p>
                That fall, I took a course on computer graphics. Our term
                project had a few basic requirements: it had to use OpenGL
                directly, demonstrate use of dynamic camera angles, and feature
                moving objects. A partner and I chose a solar system simulator –
                a common choice. However, we developed our project for the iPad.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was really fun – and frustrating. Learning OpenGL
                was hard enough. Learning the version for embedded devices was
                even more difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the project was completed, I continued to develop the
                project into a universal app with some features we didn't have
                time for during the project. I put it on the App Store for a few
                dollars; until recently, it made about $100/month and was often
                purchased in-bulk by schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking at the software now, it looks horribly outdated. The
                code is even worse. But users liked it and it was a tremendous
                learning experience. Having three apps on the store would be a
                big help later when I looked for my first job.

                kept it a secret. Looking back, I don't know why. I guess I was

                The Dean of my faculty had approached me about teaching a
                three-day instructional workshop at the university. I was really
                excited about the opportunity and devoted a lot of time over the
                academic year to creating material for the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was required to take a course every Saturday for 8 weeks to
                prepare me to instruct the workshop. It was a fantastic
                experience – many of the techniques I use when writing or

              <p>
                There were two months between getting married and moving to
                Toronto and I decided to work as a subcontractor for a local
                company. The work environment was … not ideal. There were
                problems getting paid at the end of my six-week contract.
                Finally, when the boss literally threw a cheque at me, he tried
                to snidely remark "Ash, if you need help finding a job–", at
                which point I cut him off. "I don't need your help getting a
                job", I said, and I walked away.

                It was the first time that I had ever needed to stand up for
                myself professionally. I regret getting myself into that
                situation, but I learned to recognize when things are going

                because I liked computers. I graduated with Honours in Software

              <p>
                Moving to the largest city in Canada from my rural province was
                a big step. We moved there because my wife had been accepted
                into a Masters degree at the University of Toronto, and I was
                looking forward to a more diverse job market. I interviewed with
                a bunch of companies, but one start-up caught my attention and
                was willing to pay me a handsome salary.

            </Entry>

            <Entry title="Started Terrible Job">
              <p>
                The company insisted I start as quickly as possible. I obliged,
                even though I was hoping for some time off after moving to
                Toronto. When I got to work, they didn't have anything for me to
                do. So we started off on a wrong foot. The next month was spent
                in a pretty miserable state. My hands were bound by processes
                and plans that were already in place, and even though I couldn't
                assist the web team, my boss insisted that I should stay late,
                too (even though I often had nothing to do).
              </p>
              <p>
                So a month in, I decided to quit. Being on my own,
                professionally, in a big city left me feeling isolated and
                afraid. I met a recruiter who insisted I stay at my current job
                to give us more leverage for a better salary at potential
                employers. If the company I was working for knew I was shopping
                around, they'd have fired me on the spot. The next month was
                spent sneaking off to do interviews.
              </p>
              <p>
                I felt bad. Really bad. I dreaded going in to work and I hated
                myself for deceiving my employer by expressing enthusiasm about
                future plans even though I knew I wouldn't be a part of them.
                For the first (and only) time in my life, I started drinking at
                home to relieve my anxiety. If I could go back and change

                Eventually, I found 500px. I wasn't looking forward to quitting
                – it was my first time – but my manager was pretty upset with
                me, so he didn't make me work the two weeks notice, or even the
                rest of the day.

                On the way home I stopped at a library to print off a contract
                then dropped it off at 500px. I'd start on Monday.

              <p>
                I started at an awesome company with an existing product that
                needed a mobile developer to work alongside their designer to
                create an iPad app mirroring their website. For the first few
                months, we worked out of a cramped incubator. I loved every
                second of it – my coworkers became close friends.

                At a hackathon organized by 500px, Tom and I worked together to

                submit to the App Store. Since we were 500px employees and
                ineligable for a prize, the judging panel would award us an

                Working at 500px, a website for photographers, meant that I

                fast prime lens. Photography would become my main creative

                to make an app that would tell you the best time to take
                pictures. It was very focused – you hit one button to update to
                your current location and you hit another to switch between

                We started the app later in the year, but shut it down after
                fewer than 10 issues due to lack of interest. We had about 120
                subscribers worldwide. Our hypothesis that people wanted curated
                photography presented in a minimal, ad-free environment and were
                willing to pay literally the smallest amount of money we could
                charge for it didn't pan out.

                On the first Friday in December, my wife and I decided to move

                what would be required. One of the biggest reasons to stay in
                Toronto was that I loved my job. Leaving Toronto would mean
                leaving Teehan+Lax. But we decided there would always be reasons{' '}

                On Monday, I spoke with Jon and told him of our plan to move to

                During my first week in Amsterdam, I went in to my soon-to-be

            I worked from the basement of Ashley's mother's house (there was no

            Armed with cs193p courses from Stanford (instructed that year by

            This was to be my first app. I wanted to create something that I
            would want to use. I really liked using a coffee press but would
            often forget it was brewing and spoil the coffee. A timer to make
            coffee would be perfect: simple enough to execute but meaningful
            enough to motivate me.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app was pretty simple: some models were deserialized from
            NSUserDefaults, presented in a table view, blah blah blah. It wasn't
            much, but it was mine and I was proud of it. Seeing my software run
            on my iPod touch for the first time was as close to a religious
            experience as I've ever had.
